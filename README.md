# Grader for Algorithm Design

This repository contains the source code for a grader used in algorithm design problems.

## Running the Grader

To run the grader with an input file, use the following command:

```sh
filename < (PATH_TO_INPUT.TXT)
```

### Example:

```sh
billboard < ../../input.txt
```

Replace `filename` with the actual executable or script name and specify the correct path to your input file.

can you make in .md format for me to copy?
